# Metacities
In the confluence of the web 3.0 of the METAVERSE and our current real day to day life , an idea of virtual life mimicking , enhancing and augmenting the real world is one that brings great interest. 

City life being the centre of social , trade and economy , it makes sense that the web 3.0 revolution starts from the cities the world over. 

Key to this idea is a metaverse that shares some semblance to the physical world. Geographical locations in the real world having the same counterpart in the Metaverse. A city like Bangkok with all its charms and industry having a counterpart â€“ MetaBangkok in the Metaverse , where a vibrant self-sustaining economy can be built that can be also be linked to the physical world.

We envision a phantom /overlay/ second verse city - where people immerse themselves in social interactions , games , trade - using avatars and where the digital economy much mimics the real world.
